# Etymology
Viz. is the medieval scribal abbreviation for videlicet; it uses a Tironian abbreviation. It comprises the letters v and i followed by ⁊, the common Medieval Latin contraction for et and -et. It has been included in Unicode since version 5.1. The current use of ⁊ to also mean "and" (regardless of what word means "and" in the text's language) is the only other case of remaining usage of any Tironian abbreviation. ~ Wikipedia
